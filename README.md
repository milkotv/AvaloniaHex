Fork from Washi1337's [AvaloniaHex](https://github.com/Washi1337/AvaloniaHex)

This fork is not pretending to be beautiful and is an experimentation for the following nich cases:
- Constant size HexControl
- Cyclic constant size HexControl
- Ability to fill selected bytes for constant size HexControl when Delete/Backspace is pressed or valid HEX char input is made

Please go to Washi1337's [AvaloniaHex](https://github.com/Washi1337/AvaloniaHex). It is great!
